### Future Features

**Current Version: v1.1 (1/3/2023)**

This project was developed by only me. My goal is to give back to the poker community by offering an extremely simple, lightweight, and _absolutely_ free
tournament timer (with no ads). I dip into other research topics and projects, however, I plan to add these features into the next version:

**Planned Updates for v1.2**

- Increase levels from 25 to 35.
- Include preset tournament structures.
    - WSOP Main Event
    - WPT Main Event
    - Turbo
    - Deepstack
    - Bounty
- Include more features such total chips in play and chip average.
- More eifficent and faster algorithms, make even lighter.
- Settings to slightly customize GUI.
- Donator and sponsored player page.

### Bugs

As this is a one man project, there will inevitably be bugs in the software. Please report all bugs by email **@tyleriken.proton.me**. Please include in the
email header **FTT BUG: (abstract of bug)**. In the main email, please in detail describe the bug, what happens, how it activates, and what it effects. Feel free
to include screenshots. Not all emails will be replied too, and not all bugs will be put on the fix-list. I will roll out bug fixes and updates when I can, and
prioritize them but severity.

### Sponsors

The goal of FreeTourneyTimer is to give back to the poker community with an extremely simple, lightweight, and _absolutely_ free poker tournament timer.

If you are an online streamer or live poker player who regularly plays cash games or tournament events, and would like to sponsor FreeTourneyTimer, please consider
contacting me for a patch to wear. We have a very limited number of patches available.

### Extra

Planned updates for v1.2 will come with preset tournament structures you can use. However, as someone who regularly creates/hosts tournaments, I found that this structure work best. _BB Ante_ is advised for tournaments with 12+ players. Blind levels in **bold** are optional levels that can be added to lessen variance and allow the tournament to last longer. Levels should last 20, 25, or 30 minutes.
